# Scribble-Datasets-for-Segmentation
### Installation
This converter was initially created for the [Cluster2Former](https://github.com/szlAdrian/Cluster2Former), check the installation of the that.

### Usage
In a terminal run the following command to see the usage:
```
python coco_video_to_coco_scribble_video_converter.py --help
```
or open the script and check the documentation.

We placed the converter scripts to the `datasets` folder of the Cluster2Former. We also created the empty folder(s) there, where the scribble annotations (JSON files) will be saved for each video.
